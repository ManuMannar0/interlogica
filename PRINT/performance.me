/**
 * More and smaller components
 * Take states closer to components
 * 
 * Pass Only needed Props (less props less possibility of re-render for children component)
 * Use React.Memo to avoid Rerendering (when childre component is re-rendered only when its props and state are changed)
 * 
 * Use uuid or similar for lists
 * 
 * Use useMemo (for return memoized values) and useCallback (to return memoized functions)
 * 
 * Code Splitting (dynamic import, React.lazy)
